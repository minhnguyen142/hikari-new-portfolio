        My name is Minh, I'm currently following Computer Science at Thuy Loi
        University.

        I'm now in 3rd year at university. And I'm interested in Web & Mobile
        Development. It was a hard time for me just to learn how to code and
        teach self-discipline. In the end, I still gonna try to learn at my best
        and improve myself.
      </p>

        I love programming and researching about computer things. I'm always
        looking for new things to learn.

        Though Computer Science is my major, but that's not the only thing that
        I'm focused on. Drawing is also an area I have my passion for. From my
        perspective, I think drawing is a good way to express myself. Inside the
        colorful world, there are so many thing to explore. Perhaps I could make
        put that world into programming and create something outstanding that I
        can be proud of.
